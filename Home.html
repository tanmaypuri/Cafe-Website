  <h2> This weekend's special brunch</h2>
	<p> This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is that they are made with half cream and cookied in butter, with no more than four eggs in the pan at a time.</p>
