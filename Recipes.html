		<h2 style="font-size:30px"><b>Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</b></h2>
		<p>I adopted this recipe from abook called <i>Sydney Food </i>by Bill Granger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1st visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney. I have been after the recipe I have since transformed
				it into what I really beleive are the <i>best </i>scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.<br><br>
				This recipe is what I call a "very special breakfast", just look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to be beleived.
